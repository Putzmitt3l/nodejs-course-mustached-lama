    "text": "Much research in corpus linguistics or computational linguistics occurs on data that naturally occurred. It&#x27;s part of the traditions in psychology to manipulate your subjects because that&#x27;s the only way you can get more direct observation of suspected cause&#x2F;effect relations, especially when those are subtle enough to go under in the noise in &quot;in the wild&quot; data.<p>Given a big enough sample size and a multi-factorial model (i.e. a model that models all confounding factors as well as the variable you&#x27;re interested in), the importance of manipulation should decrease, and many astronomers, economists, or computational linguists would be able to draw meaningful inferences in such a study. Psychologists may have gotten too used to the idea of &quot;get experimental subjects, present with manipulated input, do comparison statistics&quot; to consider a purely observational study as the default.<p>tl;dr: It&#x27;s not just astronomers, many fields do empirical studies without manipulating their subjects in a Skinner-ian fashion.",
