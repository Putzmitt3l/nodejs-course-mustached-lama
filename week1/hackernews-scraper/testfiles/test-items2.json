A watch that can do it well - in rain, freezing weather, with salty sweat, or sunshine - would be incredibly cool.  The strap is by far the weakest link of Garmin and Polar watches.",

AOL had a similarly weird proprietary format, Prodigy was a vector based system that could never work with anyone else, and there were countless others (Genie, etc). Meanwhile, HTML came along over PPP, and that&#x27;s when the entirety of corporate america, and residential dial-up users joined the network. The same thing is happening now with the mobile payments industry.",

This would prevent you from just fishing through their info by linking your account to random device ID&#x27;s.<p>You&#x27;d have to know the email address associated with the account, but that of course means you are using the device ID as the username and the email address as the &quot;password&quot;, which is still pretty bad in my opinion.",
